## About the Collection
Edinburgh 
by Hugh MacDiarmid
But Edinburgh is a mad god's dream
Fitful and dark, 
Unseizable in Leith
And wildered by the Forth, 
But irresistibly at last
Cleaving to sombre heights
Of passionate imagining
Till stonily, 
From soaring battlements, 
Earth eyes Eternity 

As a Scottish history buff and Gothic architecture enthusiast, I first fell in love with Glasgow and Edinburgh on a family vacation in 2022. This collection of photographs highlights some of landmarks and infamous views that make Scotland home to some of the world's most beautiful cities and richest histories.
