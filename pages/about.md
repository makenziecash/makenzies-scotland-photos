## About the Collection
<b> Edinburgh <b/>
<b> by Hugh MacDiarmid <b/>
<br> But Edinburgh is a mad god's dream <br/>
<br> Fitful and dark, <br/>
<br> Unseizable in Leith <br/>
<br> And wildered by the Forth, <br/>
<br> But irresistibly at last <br/>
<br> Cleaving to sombre heights <br/>
<br> Of passionate imagining <br/>
<br> Till stonily, <br/>
<br> From soaring battlements, <br/>
<br> Earth eyes Eternity <br/>

As a Scottish history buff and Gothic architecture enthusiast, I first fell in love with Glasgow and Edinburgh on a family vacation in 2022. This collection of photographs highlights some of landmarks and infamous views that make Scotland home to some of the world's most beautiful cities and richest histories.
